# Akka Quickstart with Kotlin

## Quickstart guide

This example is translated from the [Akka Quickstart with Java guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-java/) 
and the [getting started guide](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/guide/index.html).

The translated tests use [Spek](http://spekframework.org/).

The Hello World example illustrates Akka basics. Within 30 minutes, you should be able to download and run the example and use this guide to understand how the example is constructed. This will get your feet wet, and hopefully inspire you to dive deeper into the wonderful sea of Akka!


The original template provides build descriptors for sbt, maven and gradle. Currently only the maven has been updated. You can run 
the application with:
```
mvn compile exec:exec
```

Please feel free to update build.sbt and/or build.gradle to allow easy running through those build tools.
